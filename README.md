# Where is the script?

This resource was created in 3-4 hours for my server and was released open source due if someone neeeded something with the same things that I needed some time ago. Currently the resource uses some deprecated methods and **I would not recommend to use it**. The resource has been hidden and it will receive a recode soon. Thanks guys.
